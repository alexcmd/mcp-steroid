# Design philosophy — read this first

This document is the canonical statement of three tenets that govern every
change to MCP Steroid: code, tool surface, and prompt resources. It is
written for AI agents first (imperative) and human contributors second
(rationale at the bottom).

If you are about to **add a new MCP tool**, **add a new method to
`McpScriptContext`**, or **propose a new "helper" inside `steroid_execute_code`'s
runtime** — read this first and re-read it. Most of the time the answer is
"don't; teach the agent to call the IntelliJ API directly."

A runtime mirror of this file lives at
`mcp-steroid://skill/design-philosophy` so you can fetch it via
`steroid_fetch_resource` mid-session.

## Tenet 1 — minimal MCP tool surface

**Don't propose new `steroid_*` tools.** MCP Steroid intentionally maintains
a small set of MCP tools. Today there are 10:

- `steroid_list_projects`
- `steroid_list_windows`
- `steroid_open_project`
- `steroid_execute_code`
- `steroid_apply_patch`
- `steroid_execute_feedback`
- `steroid_action_discovery`
- `steroid_take_screenshot`
- `steroid_input`
- `steroid_fetch_resource`

This is the entire surface. The number is intentionally low. Improvements
to "agents deliver more" do **not** come from additional tools — they come
from richer prompt resources, sharper tool descriptions, and teaching the
agent to call IntelliJ APIs directly inside `steroid_execute_code`.

A new tool may be added only when **all** of these are true:

1. The need cannot be met by `steroid_execute_code` + a direct IntelliJ API
   call. Document the specific API path you ruled out.
2. It cannot be met by a richer `mcp-steroid://` prompt resource (recipe).
3. Three independent reviewers (`run-agent.sh codex` / `claude` / `gemini`)
   agree the tool is justified, after reading this file.

Anything short of that — propose a recipe instead.

## Tenet 2 — power lives in prompts and direct IntelliJ API usage

**Teach the agent to call IntelliJ's APIs as IntelliJ exposes them.** Don't
wrap them. Don't introduce parallel "agent-friendly" abstractions.

Concretely:

- **Inside `steroid_execute_code`:** call `FilenameIndex`,
  `JavaPsiFacade`, `ProjectTaskManager`, `XDebuggerUtil`, `VfsUtil`,
  `ReferencesSearch`, `MainPassesRunner`, `Observation.awaitConfiguration`,
  `smartReadAction { }`, `writeAction { }`, etc. directly. The full plugin
  classpath is loaded; typed imports work.
- **In prompt resources:** when teaching a recipe, show the canonical
  IntelliJ idiom. If the IDE-version-drift cost is real, document the drift
  inline rather than wrapping it.
- **Don't add a "helper" method to a `McpSteroid*` class** to save the
  agent from typing 5 lines of IntelliJ API. The 5 lines themselves teach
  the agent a transferable skill.
- **Reflection is fine as a probe, never in the recipe you ship.** The
  full reflection policy lives in the MCP server's startup instructions
  (the text every agent receives on session init) and at
  `mcp-steroid://prompt/skill`.

This tenet harmonises with the strategy page's *"Give AI the whole IDE,
not just the files"*: the **MCP tool** surface stays narrow on purpose;
the **IntelliJ capability** surface stays full, exposed via
`steroid_execute_code` plus prompts.

## Tenet 3 — `McpScriptContext` methods are last-resort

**Don't add methods to `McpScriptContext` casually.** The helpers
exposed to scripts running inside `steroid_execute_code` (see
`ij-plugin/src/main/kotlin/com/jonnyzzz/mcpSteroid/execution/McpScriptContext.kt`
for the current surface — `project`, `disposable`, `printJson(...)`,
`progress(...)`, `applyPatch { }`, `findProjectFile(...)`, `projectScope()`,
the inspection / highlighting helpers, etc.) exist because the
IntelliJ API genuinely could not cover the case at the time. They are
not the default extension point; the IntelliJ API is. The surface is
already substantial — that's why "don't grow it" is a tenet, not a
preference.

**Adding a new method to `McpScriptContext` requires:**

1. A short written argument that the IntelliJ-native path is genuinely
   intractable. "Less convenient" is not intractable.
2. Explicit reviewer consensus across `run-agent.sh codex` / `claude` /
   `gemini`. One reviewer disagreeing kills the proposal — propose a
   prompt-resource recipe instead.
3. The new method must teach an idiom that's reusable across many tasks,
   not specialised to one DPAIA scenario.

**`applyPatch { }` is the canonical example of why we are strict here.**
The script-context DSL exists, but production guidance routes agents to
the dedicated `steroid_apply_patch` MCP tool first; the DSL is the
fallback, not the lead. `mcp-steroid://ide/apply-patch` reflects that
ordering. New context methods must come with a similar fallback story
from day one.

## Where this comes from

External anchors (read at least one before proposing changes that touch
the tool surface or `McpScriptContext`):

- **RLM methodology** — <https://jonnyzzz.com/RLM.md>. Six-step protocol
  (assess → decide → decompose → execute → synthesize → verify) with
  context-size-driven strategy: direct processing under 4K tokens,
  grep-first up to ~50K, partition + map to parallel sub-agents above
  that or across multiple files. Applies to every code, doc, or research
  task in this repo.
- **Agentic experience and tools** —
  <https://jonnyzzz.com/blog/2026/03/24/agentic-experience-and-tools/>.
  *"Agents follow the same processes as humans. No shortcuts. No special
  agent-only paths."* This is the source of Tenet 2.
- **Strategy page** — <https://mcp-steroid.jonnyzzz.com/docs/strategy/>.
  "Give AI the whole IDE, not just the files." Phase 1 (IDE plugin) →
  Phase 2 (benchmarks) → Phase 3 (headless runtime).

## How this is used in practice

When you read this file, you should be able to:

- Identify a proposed change that adds a tool or context method, and
  reject it (or, in rare cases, accept it via the criteria above).
- Identify wording in a `mcp-steroid://` resource that wraps an IntelliJ
  API instead of teaching it, and rewrite it.
- Identify gaps where a prompt resource should exist instead of a code
  change, and write the resource.

Per-folder agent guides (`ij-plugin/CLAUDE.md`, `prompts/AGENTS.md`,
`test-integration/AGENTS.md`, `docs/CLAUDE.md`) will cite these tenets
and apply them in their local context — that propagation is tracked
under "Active focus" in `TASKS.md` (Batches 2–4). For now, only the
root `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` link here.

## For human contributors — rationale

The tenets exist because every additional tool, every additional context
method, and every wrapper helper has compounding costs:

- **Additional surface area for the agent to mis-route.** An agent that
  has 30 tools is measurably worse at picking the right one than an
  agent that has 10. Tool descriptions compete for attention in the
  agent's context.
- **Drift between tools and the IntelliJ API they were meant to abstract.**
  Wrappers fall behind on every IDE release; agents reading them learn
  yesterday's idiom.
- **Forks in the recipe corpus.** Two ways to do the same thing — the
  tool and the API — means prompts must explain both, and the agent has
  to choose. The agent picks badly more often than not.

The lever that compounds *positively* is prompt quality. Good recipes
teach the agent transferable skills it carries to the next task. Better
descriptions route the agent to the right tool first try. A `mcp-steroid://`
article with a 30-line copy-paste Kotlin snippet is worth ten new
single-purpose tools.

When in doubt: write a recipe, run the DPAIA arena, measure the delta in
tokens / tool calls / wall time, iterate.
